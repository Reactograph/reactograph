# reactograph
react component dependency graph extension for VSCode (hopefully)
I haven't found a really good react component dependency graph visualization. There are out there, but I don't love them. So why not make one the one I like! 
Planning on making dot file first, then somehow converting it into html with JS, so I can click on it and expand, and hopefully a link to the file, etc, etc, 

It's gonna be a big project!
